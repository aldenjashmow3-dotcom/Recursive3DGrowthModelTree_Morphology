## Overview
This repository contains a unified generational geometry model for simulating three-dimensional branching structures found in biological systems. The framework integrates five structural components—seed initialization, spiral phyllotaxis, helical axial ascent, recursive branching, and canopy density distribution—into a single parametric and computationally tractable model.


The goal of this project is to provide researchers, modelers, and computational biologists with a clear, adaptable structure for studying and simulating branching systems across multiple domains.

## Key Features
- **Seed Spiral Initialization**  
  Early-stage phyllotactic organization modeled with compact parametric spirals.


- **Helical Trunk Ascent**  
  Axial growth represented as a helix, consistent with vascular bundle organization.


- **Recursive Branching Engine**  
  Branch divergence controlled by rotation matrices, recursion depth, and length decay.


- **Canopy Density Distribution**  
  Spherical stochastic sampling for realistic canopy formation.


- **Surface Artifact Simulation**  
  Noise-based perturbations to approximate bark-like texture.


- **Python Reference Implementation**  
  Includes NumPy + Matplotlib code for generating full 3D structures.

## Applications
This model is applicable to a wide range of biological and natural systems, including:


- Tree morphology and canopy structure  
- Vascular branching (arterial/venous systems)  
- Neural arborization  
- Fungal hyphae networks  
- Coral growth patterns  
- River delta branching  
- Bronchial tree structures  
- General fractal or recursive biological systems  


The framework is intentionally general so it can be adapted to domain-specific constraints or datasets.
